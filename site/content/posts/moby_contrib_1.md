## Motivation

I don't have much experience in programming, only about 2 years at this point in time. I have barely got my MSc in enterprise application development this summer, but I've been working in the past 2 years as a backend developer, developing APIs for distributed systems. I have mainly worked with Java (Spring Boot) and Python as far as languages go.

I always had an interest for operating systems and virtualization technology, but I don't really know how to get started on the subject. 

I also realized I wanted to have a real impact, I wanted to contribute to something that people actually use. At my workplace the projects come and go, and you never know if your work will actually get used or it will be thrown away. That is bad for motivation (at least in my case).

## The chosen project

That being said, I decided to look at some open source projects which are in production and try to contribute to them. I have chosen [Moby](https://mobyproject.org/), which is basically a container composition framework created by (and I guess mostly from the code of) [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). This is a huge leap for me, because the project is mostly written in Go, which I'm not that familiar with. It also has a **ton** of code.
I feel like it's a great opportunity to learn about containerization and OS concepts.

I am giving myself until the beginning of September to try to learn and contribute something to the project.

If this doesn't work out, I will switch to an easier, smaller project which is closer to my current area of knowledge.
